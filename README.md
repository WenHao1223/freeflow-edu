<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>FreeFlow Edu is a <strong>revolutionary EdTech platform</strong> addressing the global challenges faced by underprivileged students, refugees, and individuals hindered by financial and societal barriers to education.

Our target demographic spans from <strong>7 to 25 years old</strong>, focusing on a wide range of learners seeking quality education.</p>
<p>We allocate our <strong>financial resources</strong> to maintain the platform (40%), hire proficient moderators (20%), and expand our expert team (40%) to ensure a robust and supportive educational environment.</p>
